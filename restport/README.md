# Goals
* Create rest based import-export django app that have included:
    * Compatible React components
    * All common table formats **Bonus**: Other non table formats like json 
* Modular
* Easy to use and add views for different imports and exports
* Glue react to django via:
    1. React in its own “frontend” Django app: load a single HTML template and let React manage the frontend (difficulty: medium)
    2. Django REST as a standalone API + React as a standalone SPA (difficulty: hard, it involves JWT for authentication)
* Well tested
    * use pytest
    * use selenium or Cypress 

* Learn
    * Functional programming with python
    * More django
    * pipenv
    * glue react and django together
    * Django server side react rendering
    * pytest
    * selenium or Cypress
